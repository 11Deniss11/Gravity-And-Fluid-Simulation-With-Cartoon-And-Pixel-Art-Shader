This is:  
- A Gravity Sim  
- A Fluid Sim  
- A Script to Create Water Visuals  
- A Script to Convert To Pixel Art  

Both of the simulations run parallel on the CPU, and will save all frames in Animations/[animation number] and final video in Animations/[animation number]/render  
The ProcessVideo script will process the latest animation and save in the Animations/[animation number]/render folder  
The pixel art script will require both an input video path and output folder path
